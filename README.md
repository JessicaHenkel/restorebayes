Materials for the evaluation of restoration projects using Bayes Decision Networks.

# Questions

* What time periods, spatial scales, or cumulative impacts (number of sites) do we want to evaluate?

* Can we scale up our simple model?  If so, what links do we want to include?

# Novelty

* We are using an empirical approach driven solely by data/conditional distributions

* We can identify effects of time, spatial scale, and cumulative impacts on water quality

# To do 

* Try expansion from the top level only, i.e., restoration project types

* Add nutrients as a variable

* Identify beneficial uses links - what can we link back to chlorophyll?
